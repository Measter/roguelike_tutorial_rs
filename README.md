## The Project

This project will consist of an individual folder for each week of the tutorial, so it can be more easily seen how the project changes over time as more complexity is added.

I chose Rust partly because I like the language, but also because it'll require me to think more about how to do things, rather than blindly follow the tutorial. I'll be trying to stick to the stable compiler, though I will be updating to the latest release as we go.

I will be building this on Windows, but the crate I'll be using for libtcod is cross-platform and I'll be trying not to do Windows-specific stuff, though I will not be testing it on other platforms.
