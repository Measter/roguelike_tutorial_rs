# Week 02

Well, it seems that `tcod` has an issue with the MSVC linker, so I had to [switch](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs/blob/master/README.md#working-with-rust-on-windows) to the GNU version of Rust.

I've split this week up corresponding to the tutorial parts. It seemed to make more sense than putting them both together.

## Week 02.1 - Graphics

I originally intended to use the default font `terminal.png`, hence the original push, but ultimately decided to stay with the tutorial's use of `arial10x10.png'.

I decided to go with a turn-based roguelike, instead of real-time. There's not really much else to say here, so let's go to the next section.
